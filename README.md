Investigating the role of GP surgeries in shaping health and social inequalities in England

## Background
- There is significant variation in deprivation levels and life expectancy across England. At the local authority-level, there is moderate correlation between the proportion of deprived households and life expectancy (r = -0.77, p < 0.0001, n = 294). A 10% increase in the number of deprived households leads to a 2.4 year reduction in life expectancy.
- Given that GP surgeries constitute the frontline of the NHS, their performance likely serves as a key determinant of deprivation and life expectancy.

## Aims
- To determine whether and to what extend GP surgery performance predicts deprivation and life expectancy at the local authority-level.
- To determine differences in GP surgery composition across rural/urban and socioeconomic divides.
- To create a tool, enabling users to investigate GP performance in their area.
